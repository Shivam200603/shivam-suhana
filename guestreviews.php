              The hotel is located on beautiful location. The ambience, amenities and the food is extra ordinary, the staff is also very friendly and the rooms are pretty big. Keep it up Raffles üëç

              The stay was pretty amazing and the rooms are quite huge with superb facilities and huge bathroom. The issues were with food, no doubt food quality and taste was up to the mark but the vegetarian option were too less. Overall highly recommended.

             We had amazing experience at Raffles Udaipur. We experienced a very warm welcome and an over pleasent saty.Amenities are fantastic! Especially the team at Raffles Udaipur deserves a huge kudos for the overwhelming experience they provide to their guests and make them feel that they are at their second home only ‚ú®

              The property is too big and lavish, perfect for events and destination weddings. We arranged destination wedding at Raffles, the arrangements and decoration done by the hotel was superb, our guest enjoyed each and every function and were too happy with their stay. Food quality and varities were too good. Thanks Raffles Udaipur for making my event memorable.

              Freindly and polite staff. Even my kids enjoyed the stay cause the hotel had a seprate kids area, they even have vast varities for breakfast. Overall nice experience but little pricey.

              The property is too far from Udaipur so once checked-in its hard to travel and explore Udaipur. The hotel was good but too expensive. So not recommended.
